Here are four implementations of basic computer vision subjects, including Image Binaryzation, Hough Circle Transform, SIFT, and Face Recgonition by Eigen Face. 

All the programs are built by OpenCV, the first three use python while the last uses C++ under Xcode.

To run them you might need to install opencv first and set up either a python-opencv environment or use Xcode for C++ programming. You can find the setup in my blog article [Install Opencv on Mac](http://sparkmorry.github.io/blog/2013/12/10/install-opencv-on-mac/)
